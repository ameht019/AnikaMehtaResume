        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a undergradute student at University of California Riverside. I am pursing a business degree, concentrating in Information Systems.<br><br>

       I have a strong passion for baking and cooking, so I turned that into something I could actively work on. I created a Youtube channel named Sweet and Savory Treats where I upload videos showing how to cook different dishes. I aim to show healthier recipes as I believe everyone should eat healthy. However, I have not been consistent on this Youtube channel I hope after college, I can further work on this channel to become more consistent. This channel has reached over 8,000 views and roughly 160 subscribers and I hope for it to grow more from here.<br><br> In addition to my cooking channel, my interest for travel vlogging started to grow so I started a channel for that as well called Anika Mehta. The purpose of this channel is to share my travel adventures with my family and friends. This channel is relatively new so I have yet to upload more videos as I travel more. My interest for business sparked when I was younger and started my own perfume company. I made a lot of profit selling my perfumes to my family members. With my interest in leadership as well, I joined the class council at my high school for three years. I gained a new level of confidence that allowed me to put myself out there and this led to my Youtube channel. This channel was my mini business and that led to my interest in taking business classes in high school, as I was unaware at the time that my passion could also be something I could pursue career wise. I was able to take Marketing and Honors Economics. These classes increased my interest for business, so I decided to pursue it further. I also have experience in different types of coding as I was interested in that computer science. I was accepted into COSMOS for the summer of 2018 where I learned MIT App Inventor, Python, and C++. These different coding languages also helped me during my internship with the Algorithms and Computing Lab at the University of California Berkeley. Hence, I am currently taking a Computer Science course in college to further my knowledge in coding.  I plan to take some higher levels of computer science and pursue a minor in this field. Currently, I am also taking the engineering pathway for mathematics. Currently I am the Director of Philanthropy for the Undergraduate Business Association and a freshman intern for the South Asian Federation club on campus. I hope to use my knowledge from my business degree to further my Youtube channels to entertain my viewers more.  Especially with some more computer skills, I hope to be able to better edit my videos and make my channel more interactive. Additionally, I plan to open my own business to give back to those who are less fortunate around the world.  This summer I plan to accept my offer at Google for a 12-week internship.
